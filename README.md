This is a weather app project implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface to search for the weather conditions of a city and display them along with a 5-day forecast. The app allows users to search for a city using a form and displays the current temperature, wind speed, and humidity of the city. The app also displays a 5-day forecast with the date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get weather data.
